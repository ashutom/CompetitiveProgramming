Microsoft Interview:

Phone: Discussion with HM about Work experience
Round1: Embedded software, OS concepts, DS/ALGO coding problem. [LC medium]
Round2: 2 DS/ALGO coding problems [LC medium]
Round3: Behavioral, Embedded C/OOPS/OS/Linux Kernel concepts
Round4: Behavioral, DS/ALGO coding [LC medium]
Round5: Behavioral, System Design, System wide debug/bring-up
Amazon Interview:

Round1: LP, DS/ALGO coding problem. [LC medium]
Round2: LP, 2 DS/ALGO coding problem [LC medium]
Round3: All LP, Domain experience
Round4: Embedded Design
Round5: LP, DS/ALGO coding problem [LC medium]
Round6: LP, and work experience, embedded systems
List down topics which embedded software guys should focus upon apart from DS-Algorithms:

Operating systems/Computer Architecture:

Process and Threads
Process Scheduling
Synchronization mechanisms (mutex/spinlock/semaphore)
Memory Management (Virtual memory/paging/translation)
Producer and Consumer Problem
Caching (cache coherency/cache line)
Memory mapped IO/ IO Mapped IO
Linux Kernel concepts:

Buffer sharing: DMA Buf & ION
Wait events/Wait queues
ISR handling (Top half/Bottom half)
Bottom Half - Tasklet/Workqueue/SoftIRQ
Platform driver
Driver probe (Module init, driver register, compatibility string)
Device Tree (Device nodes and parsing)
Clocks/Regulators/GPIO/Pinctrl
IOMMU/MMU
Timer Library
IOCTL, notify dirent
kmalloc/vmalloc
kmap/mmap/ioremap
sysfs/debugfs/procfs
PS: I will be joining Microsoft.
